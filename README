What's Wrong With My NLP?
-------------------------

What's Wrong With My NLP? is visualizer and graphical diff for Natural Language Processing problems. It can
jointly display syntactic and semantic dependencies as well as all types of chunk information such as NP, NER or
SRL chunks. It also allows you to compare your system output to a gold standard in order to find the mistakes
your system does. There are numerous ways to filter the graph and only display what is needed. It is also possible
to search a corpus for sentences with certain properties using lucene search expressions. The tool reads all
CoNLL shared task formats and exports to EPS.
